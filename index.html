  <h1>My Connections Puzzles</h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Hello! This is a collection of some Connections puzzles that I have created. Connections is a game created by the New York Times, and I used the concept and the public website <a href='https://connections.swellgarfo.com/', target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swellgarfo</a> to create some of my own. I assume that you already know how to play Connections.
  </p>

  <p>
    My puzzles have been tested and are playable at the Swellgarfo links below. I have added tags to the puzzles that I think are 
    <ul id="tag_list">
        <li>hard,</li>
        <li>extreme (very hard),</li>
        <li>GPTS (good places to start), and/or</li>
        <li>CE (mention current events as of the puzzle date).</li>
    </ul>
    As the tags show, I think I have become a better writer over time. (And my testers certainly agree!) As a puzzle writer, I try to avoid pop culture references, as it's not a good time to be stumped because you haven't watched a particular movie or read a specific book series, so I try to avoid them in my clues. Other than that, I hope you have fun! Happy solving!

    Note: Puzzle 6 is not included because it includes the names of people who are close to me. As a puzzle writer, I also have made KenKens in the past!
